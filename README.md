# Capstone project for AIML AUG Batch 2019 

Below is the capstone details. We will be finalising on the functional problem once we talk to a mentor on this. Also note that the other 3 member of this group is cc-d in email. Let us know if you need more info.

Machine Reading Comprehension using NLP Techniques for Q&A

The prime objective of this study is to develop a Machine Reading Comprehension system which can help to understand and digest large volume of text from PDF’s or websites and will be capable to answer any question related to the subject. The model will be trained using open data sets from SQUAD and others places. The training set will represent a language understanding model hence more diverse data we provide to train generally better.

The functional problem that this system will target will be either one of the below  -

* Help a financial consultant to ask a question given a document of his own and answer precisely as possible
* Help a teacher to check the answers of student against a a questionnaire in a specific subject (English, history, GK)
* Help to answer questions against a contract document 
* Help to build a knowledge base of products from a product’s user manual and then provide quick answer for questions around it- can be used to reply to user queries about it
* Application in legal tech
* News QnA
